# Write Content

Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text. You can use Markdown syntax, along with some additional HTML tags, to format your writing on GitHub or any other git repository.

If you're new to Markdown, you might want to start with "[Basic syntax](basic-syntax/index.html)" or [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).

If you already have a profile README, you can follow this guide by adding some features to your existing README, or by creating a gist with a Markdown file called something like about-me.md. For more information, see "Creating gists."
